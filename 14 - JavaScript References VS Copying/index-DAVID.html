    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const copy = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(copy === players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players.push('David');
    
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(copy, players)

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const copy2 = players.slice();
    players.push('Harry');

    console.log(copy2, players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy3 = [].concat(players);
    players.push('Joe');

    console.log(copy3, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy4 = [...players];
    players.push('Marry');

    console.log(copy4, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const copy5 = Array.from(players);
    players.push('Tom');

    console.log(copy5, players);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const objectCopy = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    
    console.log(objectCopy, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const objectCopy2 = {...person};
    person.age = 33;
    
    console.log(objectCopy2, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
